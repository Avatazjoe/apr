        If you run a service business such as a salon, dental clinic, or a law firm then you know that your time is extremely valuable.  You have to keep a strict schedule so that your can earn more, because <strong>every minute that you do not spend with a client means less money</strong> for your business.

        Your clients are also busy people and they sometimes forget about their appointments with you.  This causes disruptions in your schedule, costs you revenue, and may hurt your professional relationship with clients.  AppointWare helps you solve this problem but letting you easily remind clients of their appointments.  This <strong>increases both revenue and customer satisfaction</strong>.

        AppointWare lets you <strong>send reminders to your clients automatically</strong>!  On our easy-to-use website, you can simply type in the client's contact information and appointment details and we shall do the rest.   We send out appointment reminders by email and/or by SMS.  That's it - there is no special software or hardware to buy and install, just use your regular computer or phone.

        Our customers have reported that using AppointWare results in <strong>decreased cancellations and no-shows</strong>.  Many customers save a full-time employee (or more) who used to spend time with bulky phone calls and ridiculous spreadsheets to handle appointment reminders manually.

        Perhaps after a client's appointment you want to <strong>remind them to come back in one month, or one year</strong>?  AppointWare let's you do that as well!  Auto-magically.
